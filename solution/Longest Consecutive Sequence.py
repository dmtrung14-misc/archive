# Although the time complexity appears to be quadratic due to the while
# loop nested within the for loop, closer inspection reveals it to be
# linear. Because the while loop is reached only when currentNum marks
# the beginning of a sequence (i.e. currentNum-1 is not present in
# nums), the while loop can only run for nnn iterations throughout the
# entire runtime of the algorithm. This means that despite looking like
# O(n⋅n)O(n \cdot n)O(n⋅n) complexity, the nested loops actually run in O(n+n)=O(n)O(n + n) = O(n)O(n+n)=O(n)
# time. All other computations occur in constant time, so the overall
# runtime is linear.
